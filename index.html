                                    <p>I have spent the majority of my life in Kankakee County. I love this community and count it a privilege to serve it by providing high-quality home inspections. I became a home inspector because safety is important to me. I translate my passion into my work by providing information you need to make your home safe.</p>
                                    <p>My wife Jennifer is also a small business owner serving Kankakee County. She is a speech-language pathologist who provides in-home services from birth to age three. My wife and I have two beautiful boys, Easton and Camden. They are a complete joy (most of the time!). The one thing I value most is my faith in Jesus Christ. Because of His sacrifice on the cross, I have hope beyond this life.</p>

                                <p>A full professional home inspection is performed for the property seller, and is conducted before the property is shown. This allows for a full disclosure of the property and proper receipts showing all improvements completed. The seller can set a solid price, eliminating bargaining points, leading to a faster sale.</p>

                                <p>As a buyer you want to have a good idea of the condition of the home before you write that check. A buyer's inspection will notify you of any concerns big or small. This information can help in negotiations and prepare you for any upcoming maintenance on your new home.</p>

                                <p>During the inspection our licensed professionals will inspect your home inside and out, top to bottom. This includes details about the condition of the roof (when accessible) as well as the foundation and attic spaces. When the inspection is complete you will receive a detailed report complete with pictures.</p>
                                <p>Your concerns matter to us! This is why at the end of every inspection our inspectors will speak with you and give you a brief summary of what we found and answer any of your questions. Your written report is ready to review in an easy to understand report within 24 hours of the inspection.</p>

                                <p>It is recommended to get your home tested for Radon Gas every 2 years. We encourage all our home buyers and sellers to get this test done at the time of the inspection.</p>

Air quality tests measure the air for things that are known to cause these symptoms. These tests can show whether the quality of your indoor air is either safe or dangerous.</p>
                                <p>We offer air quality testing so that you can feel safer in your own home. Our inspectors will take samples depending on the size of your home. These samples are then sent to a lab and an official detailed report will be provided.</p>

                                <h3>What is radon gas?</h3>
                                <p>Radon comes from the natural (radioactive) breakdown of uranium in soil, rock, and water, entering the air you breathe. Radon is colorless and odorless. It can infiltrate any type of building -homes, offices, and schools - and build up to high levels. But you and your family will most likely receive your greatest exposure where you spend most of your time in your home.

                                    Breathing air that contains radon can cause lung cancer. In fact, the Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States today.
                                    
                                    There are simple, relatively inexpensive measures for radon mitigation that you can take to fix a radon problem and even very high levels can be reduced to acceptable levels. Ask about our radon testing services.</p>
